<%# Display any comments associated with this article  %>
<h2>Comments:</h2>

<%# Since articles have a has_many association with comments, the @article object now has a .comments method that returns an array of all comments associated with this article. Here, we loop through the associated comments and display the attributes of each comment, which are :commenter and :body.  %>
<!--
<%# @article.comments.each do |comment| %>
  <p>
    <strong>Commenter:</strong>
    <%# comment.commenter %>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Comment:</strong>
    <%# comment.body %>
  </p>
<%# end %>
-->

<%# Here, we move the html and erb for displaying a comment into a partial named app/views/comments/_comment.html.erb. Using render, we can pass it a collection of comments associated with this article, and it will pass each comment as the variable comment (because the partial is named _comment) to the partial to be rendered. This effectively creates the same .each statement as the commented-out portion above. %>
<%= render @article.comments %>

<%# Create a form to post a comment related to this Article  %>
<h2>Add a comment:</h2>

<%# We pass an array as the model: attribute because we have nested routes in our config/routes.rb file. To post a comment, we send a POST request to the following url /articles/:id/comments, so we need to build a comment based off of this article to pass in with the form.  %>
<!--
<%#= form_with(model: [@article, @article.comments.build], local: true) do |form| %>
  <p>
    <%#= form.label :commenter %>
    <%#= form.text_field :commenter %>
  </p>
  <p>
    <%#= form.label :body %>
    <%#= form.text_area :body %>
  </p>
  <p>
    <%#= form.submit %>
  </p>

<%# end %>
-->

<%# We move the rendering of the form out to a partial located at app/views/comments/_form.html.erb. The @article instace variable will be used in this partial, and is available to it because it was passed to this view by the controller.  %>
